TakeCare - Ready when you are not

Prepare for the unexpected
Saying goodbye to loved ones is tough... especially when it happens out of sudden. From one moment to the next family and friends are left behind with pain, loss and difficult questions regarding personal legacy, health, finance – and eventually, the funeral. That’s why we’ve build TakeCare: A platform that helps people to organize and share their personal wishes in the case of death. So everyone involved can truly focus on what matters most in such moments: Saying goodbye – and celebrating life together.
